## What all these scrips are about

These scripts visualize the data for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). PM2.5 is an airpollutant which is proven to be harmful to humans. 
The data was gathered by NEI, you can find the detail info [here](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html)

The original dataset for these scripts is [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip). It contains the data for years 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Each script answers one questions.

The list of questions answered by these scripts is as follows:

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

## How to run these scripts

Download the original dataset, unzip it, copy files to your working directory and run the scripts. DONE! The resulting images will appear also in the working directory.

## Can I use these scripts?

Yes, feel free to take them and adapt to your needs. The only restriction is: please, don't submit it as your assignment anywhere. I did spend a lot of time on it and I just hate when someone breaks the honor code. ;)
